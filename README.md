# WP Twilio Core

WP Twilio core is a simple plugin to add SMS capability to your website using the Twilio API. 

If you've ever wanted to add text messaging functionality to your website or app, [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is one of the best solutions on the market. They're reasonably priced and have an excellent API. 


How does it work?
-

The plugin primarily allows a WordPress developer to extend its settings and functionality and integrate it into any type of site. For example, it can easily be extended to send a text message on virtually any WordPress action.

The plugin also includes functionality to directly send a text message to any permissible number from the plugin settings page. You can use it to SMS any of your users or just for testing purposes

Here's a list of what the plugin provides out of the box:

* Custom function to easily send SMS messages to any number (including international ones)
* Functionality to directly send a text message to any permissible number from the plugin settings page
* Hooks to add additional tabs on the plugin settings page to allow managing all SMS related settings from the same page
* Basic logging capability to keep track of up to 100 entries
* Mobile Phone User Field added to each profile (optional)
* Shorten URLs using Google URL Shortener API (optional)

<h3>twl_send_sms( $args )</h3>
<p>Sends a standard text message from your Twilio Number when arguments are passed in an array format. Description of each array key is given below.</p>
Array Key | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | ----
number_to | string | The mobile number that will be texted. Must be formatted as country code + 10-digit number (i.e. +13362522164).
message | string | The message that will be sent to the recipient.
number_from *(optional)* | string | Override the Twilio Number from settings. Must be associated with Account SID and Auth Token

<h5>Example</h5>

```php
$args = array( 
	'number_to' => '+13362522164',
	'message' => 'Hello Programmer!',
); 
twl_send_sms( $args );	
```

<h3>Extending the Settings page</h3>
<p>It is very easy to add your own tab to the plugin settings page. Please see the example below:</p>

```php
// Registering a new tab name
function add_new_settings_tab( $tabs ) {
	$tabs['my_shop'] = 'My Shop';
	return $tabs;
}
add_filter( 'twl_settings_tabs', 'add_new_settings_tab' );

// Adding form to that new tab
function add_my_shop_tab_content( $tab, $page_url ) {
	if( $tab != 'my_shop' ) {
		return;
	} 
	// Add my settings form here!
}
add_action( 'twl_display_tab', 'add_my_shop_tab_content', 10, 2 );
```
